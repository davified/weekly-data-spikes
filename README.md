# Weekly Data Spikes

A collection of spikes on various tools, libraries and practices on machine learning and data engineering. (A **spike** is a time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype.)

## Machine Learning

ML as a Service (MLaaS)
- [Algorithmia](https://github.com/davified/algorithmia-spike)

Model deployments
- [Continuous delivery pipeline for ML models](https://github.com/davified/ml-ci-cd-demo)

## Data Engineering


## Contribution guide
